* Interpretability logics
  The logic gl is the logic of provability which studies the behaviour of the
  provability predicate. In this logic we have two modal operators. The first
  one is box which stands for provability. And the second operator is diamond,
  which stands for consistency. Note that usually we define diamond in terms of
  box since saying that A is consistent is the same as saying that we cannot
  prove the negation of A.
