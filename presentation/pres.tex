\title{Generalised Veltman Semantics in Agda}

% Luka: Hi all! I agree with Joost's suggestion. Jan, also take into account
% that since our talk is a short presentation we have about 10 minutes to
% present (and then 5 minutes for questions). I'd suggest to focus on basics
% (what is Veltman semantics, what is Agda etc.) and less on the results

% Joost: Hi Jan, when composing the slides, please be very modest in your aims
% Here's what Luka writes about his presentation
% I'd suggest we focus on interpretability logics in general, then a bit about IL(All),
% Indeed, it is good to get the basics straight
% So, the first --at least-- five minutes should be dedicated entirely to
% a slow and gentle introduction to interpretability logics
% if not, the first seven
% if you want, you can sketch the idea
% but no full proofs
% ideas and summaries are more important

% We cannot assume that people know the logics that we work with
% so we have to slowly introduce them and motivate them
% give some examples
% The last five minutes can be used to hint at the work we have done
% Or last four minutes

  \frametitle{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Generalised Veltman semantics are a kind of relational semantics (à la
    Kripke) for \textbf{interpretability logics}. \break \pause
    \item Agda is a \textbf{proof assistant} based on dependent type theory.
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Interpretability Logics}
  In the logic of provability \gl we have that:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $□A$ means ``A is provable''.
    \item $♢A$ means ``A is consistent''. Note that $♢A=¬□¬A$.
  \end{itemize}
  The aim of \gl is to describe the provably structural behaviour of the
  formalised provability predicate.

  \pause \vspace{0.5cm}

  Interpretability logics extend the provability logic \gl. There is an
  additional binary modal operator $▷$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $A▷B$ means ``A interprets B''.
  \end{itemize}
  The aim is to find a logic that describes exactly all provably structural
  behaviour of the notion of interpretability.

  \textbf{Definition}
  We say that A interprets B if there is an interpretation of B into A.

  An interpretation of a theory $B$ into a theory $A$ is a translation $⋆$ that
  maps the non-logical symbols in the language of $B$ to formulas in the
  language of $A$ with the same free variables, so that
  \[B⊢ϕ⇒ A⊢ϕ^⋆\]

  Examples of interpretations (copied from Visser's overview):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The interpretation of arithmetic in set theory.
    \pause
  \item Gödel's interpretation of $\zf+\veql$ in \zf. This interpretation
    provides a relative consistency proof of \zf + CH w.r.t. \zf.
    \pause
  \item The interpretation of elementary syntax in arithmetic. Important for
    Gödel's incompleteness theorems.
  \end{itemize}
